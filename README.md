# Harpia Game Engine
Game Engine made with learning purposes. My idea is to train my knowledge with C++ language and different aspects of engine/ development.

The original engine was started around 2008, with the name of `RGine`, being uploaded to Google Code in 2011 and migrated to Github in 2015. In 2022 I decided to give it another try and see how far I can get.
